# Real-time Object Detection For Disaster Management From Aerial Imagery
A deep learning approach for disaster detection and victim localization for real time and effective disaster management.
(Quantized DNN for Classification of UAV Aerial Imagery for Disaster Detection and Response)

This repository has extended the work of CVPRW 2019 Paper [Deep-Learning-Based Aerial Image Classification for Emergency Response Applications Using Unmanned Aerial Vehicles
](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.08716) and its 2020 revision as [EmergencyNet: Efficient Aerial Image Classification for Drone-Based Emergency Monitoring Using Atrous Convolutional Feature Fusion](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9050881) for efficient disaster management. 

## Features
We have added the following additional features to the work of previously mentioned papers:
- Two new architecture for AIDER with improved performance and efficiency
- Quantized versions of proposed architectures 
- Accelerated inference speed
- A new dataset AIDER-Detect for victim localization
- Yolov3 and Yolov4 for AIDER Detect
- Quantized Yolo for AIDER Detect
- Power efficient networks
